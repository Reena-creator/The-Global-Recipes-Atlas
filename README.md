# 🌍 Global Recipes Atlas

**Global Recipes Atlas** is a modern recipe discovery platform built with React JS that allows users to search for recipes from around the world using the Spoonacular API. The website provides quick access to thousands of recipes, each with images and direct links to cooking instructions.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **User Enters a Keyword**  
   The user types an ingredient or dish name (e.g., "pasta", "paneer") in the search bar.

2. **API Call to Spoonacular**  
   The app uses the Spoonacular API to fetch relevant recipes based on the search query.

3. **Recipes Displayed with Pagination**  
   Recipes (including title and image) are displayed in a grid. Each recipe card links to the original cooking instructions.

4. **Pagination**  
   The user can click **Prev** or **Next** buttons to load more results using the API's `offset` parameter.

5. **Loading Spinner**  
   A spinner is shown while results are being fetched to enhance the user experience.
